Creativity  is kind of "inflated" as a concept.

In reality, creativity is much more mundane - for instance, a new recipe, these diary entries or thoughts, or a hand-drawn sketch. It doesn't need to be a very extensive work to be creative. Of course, if there _is_ creative work, it's absolutely fine and praiseworthy, but there's something good in the everyday creativity.
