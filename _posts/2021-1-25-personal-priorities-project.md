## Personal Priorities Project - Originally Written on 27/4/2018

I've just realised that I've been thinking so much about collective criteria and evaluation that I haven't really formally or properly considered my own personal priorities.

Things I value: 
- Spending time with the people I care about 
- Low-cost leisure activities
- Self-expression
- Easy access or connection to (a) social group(s)
- An ability to be silly
- Helping other people in some small way, e.g. enriching their lives
- I like getting positive reinforcement, though this can also be a weakness, in that it is _extrinsic_, rather than _intrinsic_
- Low stress environments and slower pace lifestyle
- The ability to feel part of a team
- Having some time to be alone and work on my own stuff (e.g. this :p )
- Gentle learning, e.g. engaging in a slow learning process
- Being outside in nature once a day, feeling of fresh air

Now I feel I specifically enjoy being around and helping friends more, it's nice to be able to share time with them.
