Love transcends transcendence, in that it is both universal and particular.

Universal, because it expresses some of the same feeling in each manifestation.\
Particular, in that each person expresses it in their own particular way.

Music also transcends transcendence, in that we can each access music, but every expression is unique. It is in this diversity and universal accessibility that gives it part of its beauty and wonder. What it makes me feel may be very different to you, for exactly the same set of sounds.

The above thoughts show the limits of no limitation; the lacking in transcendence. Because "transcend" means to "go beyond", transcendence cannot capture the preciousness of a particular instance, and is always abstract.
