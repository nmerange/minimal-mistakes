My understanding of the current international economic environment is that low levels of economic growth are expected in the developed world for the next decade, along with continued large opportunities and risks for employment with the constant emergence of disruptive technologies. This is changing the way products are produced, marketed, and distributed, not to mention business models themselves and chances for future stable employment. 
  
Politics both nationally and internationally seems focussed on “winning back” local control partially in the hope that this will help address this employment uncertainty. The mainstream debate nationally and internationally though is still on whether and how government intervention should be involved in creating more inclusive and stable economic opportunities, or whether it should be the role of the market to allocate resources.
