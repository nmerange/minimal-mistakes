## Doing Stakeholder consultation

When conducting a consultation, it is as important to note who _isn't_ in the room as who is. If someone who has an interesting or different perspective isn't present, then the person conducting that consultation will never get that perspective, unless they conduct a separate consultation. This is true for almost any complex social policy area in which you are seeking to hear diverse opinions about what the situation is from various perspectives

#### The importance of Inclusion

If people are engaged in the process of designing their own future, then they are more likely to work to ensure that the intervention is successful. It may fail, but it won't be because no-one is interested in seeing it work.

A challenge, though, is getting everyday community members to participate in the first place. People are busy and would prefer to do their own thing most of the time. The easiest way to engage people is to look at what's annoying or angering them and see if it can be addressed.
