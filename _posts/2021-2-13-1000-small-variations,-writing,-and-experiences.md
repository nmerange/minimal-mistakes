The greyness of the lightpole\
Is not uniform\
It is mottled with 1000 small variations

The greyness of the city\
Is not uniform\
It is mottled with 1000 small variations, a colour of movement, and the sound of activity

They greyness of life\
Is not uniform\
It is mottled with 1000 small variations\
Each day looks similar\
But if you pay attention, each day is slightly different, creating a tapestry of patterns

Unlike a pole, our lives are not stationary.\
We change, move and turn\
If we walk in one direction, and others move in another toward us, we meet in half the time.

Each meeting is meaningful\
Each non-meeting is meaningful\
The meetings we don't have shape us all\
Alone, you can meet yourself. Your many-selves.\
You can meet an idea, a feeling, or a need

We sometimes need to look for the small differences. Each day I am a little different from the last. Even if I stand still, the earth moves around me, and if I move, so does the world.


### On Writing

Yet if I write, I am not experiencing (I am _doing_)\
If I am genuinely experiencing, I am not writing.\
Therefore, writing is a projection, memory, or an ideal in the mind's eye.\
It is not the experience itself

IF I write in public, I may be in part engaging in a process of self-discovery and "being-in-the-world", yet I am also a bit detached from the world. I am also partially engging in a performance as _The Poet_, which has "romantic" connotations. 

We are like quantum states.\
When observed, we change, conforming, _collapsing_ into one form of being or another.\
The consciousness who observes the world is conscious of the consciousness of me.\
I, too, am aware of their attention

Our consciousness tries to make sense of the world, makes it meet our expectations, to some extent, yet the illusion only stretches so far. Even if we are aware, we never know how far away we are from "reality". This is not a bad thing, we need consciousness to fix problems in our lives, to create magnificent and mundane thoughts, relationships and decisions.

Our bodies are just as important, alive beings, pulsing systems of movement within us.\
I can say that _**I**_ would not be here without it.
