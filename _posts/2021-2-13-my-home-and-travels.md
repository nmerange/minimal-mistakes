_(Originally written 21/6/2019)_

My home is here\
My home is there\
My home is here in Melbourne\
My home is in the world

I am both of my country\
And the Earth\
I am proud of my country\
Aware of its flaws\
Yet I do not see it as superior to any other

I have been spoilt\
In my travels\
By the hospitality of others\
I hope to learn\
(and maybe am slowly learning)\
The art of hospitality _to_ others

Mostly, I have preferred to lend advice or a hand rather than resources,\
Yet I've always received resources from others, in so many countries, including my own

I am forever grateful for their generosity.
