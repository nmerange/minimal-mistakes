Title: The April Cold

Feeling stresssed and overshwelmed in my brain\
Hoping that sanity will remain\
We must all stay still to stop this curse\
To avoid the bad from getting worse

With my actions come doubt and fear\
I must focus on the now and here\
My thoughts: boring, predictable and tired?\
It matters not, 'cause they're not hired

I can write whatever I like\
It can be about a car ride or a hike\
It doesn't need to be deep or insightful\
Nor melancholic, nor e'en delightful

It's just nice to write, with a meter\
It doth turn cold. Where's my heater?\
The day appears, so dark and dreary\
I hope to stay alive, and not feel weary

It is easier for in pen to write\
Not type away at PC's light\
I still abstain; heater's not on\
(My housemate doesn't want it and so the options gone)

I think this will lead to trouble down t'track\
One housemate doesn't want heat, so will want money back\
Yet I turn it on, situation's now resolved\
The heater's on, and I'm no longer cold
