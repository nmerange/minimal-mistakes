## On Sexism

There's a key difference between the concepts of sexism and Misogyny. Sexism is the unfair treatment of another person on the bases of apparent sexual identity, whereas misogyny is the maltreatment of women. All misogyny is sexist, but not all sexism is Misogyny. 

This is important because it implicitly acknowledges the possibility of sexism to non-women, such as Men and other sexual identities (I don't want to get into a debate 

A key thing Men's Rights Activists and Feminists have in common is that they both see the harm in expectations being put onto men and women, respectively. Feminists are unfortunately not very interested in trying to understand the MRA viewpoint, because in fact, some of the structural inequalities that men face are the cause of structural inequalities womenface - as a result of structural sexism - tightly defined roles or expectations about the proper role each group should play in society.

For example, because women are expected to be caretakers and men money-earners, it results in custody suits being awarded disproportionately to women and the need for men to pay alimony. But it is perhaps this same process that underlies part of the imbalance in household chores and caring for young children.
