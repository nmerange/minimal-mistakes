When we think of Mental Processes, we might start to look at an obvious place:

That is, Cognition (Thinking)
And then, naturally, it seems the next step would be:
Meta Cognition (Thinking about thinking), and so on.

This meta-cognition seemingly can be experienced simultaneously, or with the latter following the former, usually immediately after, but maybe also some time later.

Another side of this, though, which seems obvious but sometimes gets lost, is that both of these processes may be accompanied by feelings or sentiments

Adding these to the model, though, gives us some more interesting interactions between these mental processes, and might help understand how we might get so confused, overwhelmed, and reactive.
