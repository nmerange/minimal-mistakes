When we think of Mental Processes, we might start to look at an obvious place:\
That is, Cognition (Thinking)

And then, naturally, it seems the next step would be:\
Meta Cognition (Thinking about thinking), and so on.

This meta-cognition seemingly can be experienced simultaneously with thinking, or after cognition. Often immediately after, but maybe also some time later, when the penny drops.

Another side of this, though, which seems obvious but sometimes gets lost, is that both of these processes may be accompanied by feelings or "sentiments" (as David Hume called them).

Adding these to the basic model of mental processes gives us maybe some more interesting interactions between them, and might help understand how we might get so confused, overwhelmed, and reactive.

See below:

We can see from the above table that we don't really have a word for our "feelings about our feelings". I propose "meta-sentimentality". It's probably already been coined, since it's an obvious equivalent to "meta-cognition."

Also, in reality, our thoughts and feelings are not necessarily so distinct, for example, you might be having the feeling of love, and the thought of "I am happy" might also exist and be mixed up in that. However, the thought of happiness could arise _on reflection of_ the experience of feeling love, or similarly you experience the feeling of love due to the fact that you have the thought that "I am happy".

One aspect of experience I _haven't_ considered here and is perhaps more powerful than either is the experience of sensation. Sensations are our immediate sense-perceptions, and exist outside  these thoughts and feelings. It's tempting to say they are outside the "mental space" entirely, perhaps embodied throughout our nervous system. Hence they are able to be used in practices such as mindfulness that ground people who are feeling otherwise overwhelmed with the mental  processes of thought and feeling. 

For example, we don't neeed to understand that something is hot before we move our hand away from it. It can easily dominate over feeling and thought in our mental space, which may be a good thing.
