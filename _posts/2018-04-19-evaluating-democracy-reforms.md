There are several promising democracy reforms being considered at the moment, some based on technology while some are not. This is not a comprehensive list, but rather an overview of the most significant efforts I'm aware of after being exposed to several as part of [Designing Open Democracy](www.designingopendemocracy.com). The descriptions, evaluations and summaries here are rough and open to further revision, readers are encouraged to provide suggestions as to what things should be included and excluded in the following summaries or how I might consider adjusting my evaluation and why. 

The primary goal here is to provide a rough evaluation of these interventions, their relative strengths and weaknesses in comparison to each other and our existing democracy according to certain criteria of what we're after in a good democratic system. The following comprises a list of interventions I'll be considering here.

### Interventions Being Considered
**Tech-based reforms:**
* [Mivote](https://www.mivote.org.au/what_is)
* [Flux](https://voteflux.org/)
* [Online Direct Democracy](https://www.onlinedirectdemocracy.org/)

**Non-Tech Based reforms:**
* [Citizens' Juries](https://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/what-is-a-citizens-jury)

**Other reforms not being considered:**
* Voting Machines
* Discussion platforms, such as kialo, argumen, polity, pol.is, etc.
* GILT/Prediki's Proposal for a citizen parliament plus some sort of prediction-making ranking system to see who is providing accurate predictions of what's going on to sort information. This isn't being included due to the lack of familiarity with the system
* NewVote's proposal, as I am not familiar enough with what it entails, suffice to say it has a mixture of things involved - upvoting/downvoting comments to sort information, use of pol.is's system of idea grouping, and some other stuff
* Groups or reforms that I essentially see as more incremental, such as reforms increasing transparency, openness in decision-making, or increasing ease of access to legislators. These reforms may be worthwhile, but likely would not make a significant impact, or would be made redundant if a new system was adopted. These reforms will be more useful the less user-friendly the government decision-making process is.

In principle, any intervention could be assessed using the following criteria. However, it is important to consider which criteria are appropriate and why; we should not necessarily aim for an intervention that does everything, but perhaps a series of interventions that can specialise in certain areas. The most important part of any system though is who gets decision-making power, and how does this manifest?

## Summary of Interventions Being Considered

#### [**Mivote**](https://www.mivote.org.au/what_is)

Issue-Based information aggregation and informed voting software

How does it work?
* Via app, person opts in/opts out of question being discussed
* Presents information on a topic, say, housing, along with different frameworks for understanding the topic
* After noting that the person has read some info on the topic (the 'information pack' provided), it gives at least 4 different 'policy approaches' to an issue that could plausibly be taken, person voting picks one

#### [**Flux**](https://voteflux.org/about/how/)

Issue-Based Liquid Democracy with tweaks

How does it work?
* Each bill in parliament is given a chance to be voted on (In future, it is likely to be possible for people to create the own bills, with votes available for each of those)
* Can choose to give your vote to someone else who votes on your behalf, and you can take back your delegation at any time
* Can choose to not vote, and instead gain political capital that can be spent later on future votes (How much political capital can be saved, whether it becomes less valuable, and over what period is something unresolved right now as far as I can tell)
* Plan to implement a system for bidding for political capital, where suppply/demand of political capital on a particular vote determines the value of each political capital - the more people are bidding for tokens, the lower the value of each token used, and the higher value given for saving tokens

#### [**Online Direct Democracy**](https://www.onlinedirectdemocracy.org/how-the-party-works/)

Direct Democracy

* Each bill is voted on, for/against
* People able to propose their own bills, which are in turn voted on
* Online Direct Democracy Reps vote with majority view from votes
* Initial bills can be agreed on in principle, then worked out further later on
* Pros and cons of each bill can be given 

#### [**Citizens' Juries**](https://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/what-is-a-citizens-jury)

According to [NewDemocracy](https://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/what-is-a-citizens-jury), "a Citizensâ€™ Jury is a group of randomly selected members of a community convened to consider a given topic and provide a response or recommendation to the governing body".

Normally, there is a power to call expert witnesses for testimony, engage in group deliberation and discussion on the basis of information presented, and arrives at a majority viewpoint for how to address a particular issue. In NewDemocracy case it's 80%.

Crucial to this is defining the topic given.


## Evaluation Criteria

### Priciples underlying Evaluation Criteria - What does good government seek to do?

There are several aspects of Democratic decision-making that are considered valuable:
- Effectiveness: Whether better public policy on the existing information available gets produced, however that's defined. e.g. Does it help us solve problems in the best way, deal with the biggest challenges facing us, and generally make excellent decisions?
- Freedom 
    - To decide who to vote for or the policy involved
    - To decide what issues matter
- Fairness
    - Each person gets one vote
    - Each person's vote is counted and given equal weight
- Transparency:
    - Reasoning Transparency - people can see why policy X was adopted
    - Procedural transparency - people can in principle have access to the system process and see what happened at each stage (e.g. when did my representative vote on issue X and how did they vote)
- Participation and Inclusion
    - I want to feel like my needs/interests can be represented
    - Each person has a chance to contribute to decision-making
    
    
#### List of Evaluation Criteria

Based off these principles, and preceding discussions about creating criteria to determine the value of differing democracy interventions, a list of criteria were created to evaluate democracy reforms. Each intervention was rated out of 10 in each criterion, with a score of 5/10 given for existing Australian Democracy. Thus a score of 5 means that the reform scores about the same on that criterion as existing democracy, with 10 being 'a lot more' than Australian democracy, and 0 being a lot less.

This is to help evaluate the comparative advantage (and disadvantage) of the proposals relative to some reference point that made sense to people. No reform has to be perfect, it just has to be better than what we have. 


Protection from vote tampering and fraud - It should be noted that vote tampering never occurs in developed countries, but has been reported with decent frequency in developing countries
