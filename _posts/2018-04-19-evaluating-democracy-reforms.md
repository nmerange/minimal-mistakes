There are several promising democracy reforms being considered at the moment, some based on technology while some are not. This is not a comprehensive list, but rather an overview of the most significant efforts I'm aware of after being exposed to several as part of [Designing Open Democracy](www.designingopendemocracy.com). The descriptions, evaluations and summaries here are rough and open to further revision, readers are encouraged to provide suggestions as to what things should be included and excluded in this descriptions or where I should adjust my evaluation and why. 

The primary goal here is to provide a rough evaluation of these interventions, their relative strengths and weaknesses to each other and our existing democracy, according to certain criteria of what we're after in a good democratic tool. The folowwing comprises a list of interventions I'll be considering here.

###Interventions Being Considered
**Tech-based reforms:**
* [Mivote](https://www.mivote.org.au/what_is)
* Flux
* Online Direct Democracy

**Non-Tech Based reforms:**
* Citizens Juries

**Other reforms not being considered:**
* Voting Machines
* Discussion platforms, such as kialo, argumen, polity, pol.is
* GILT/Prediki's Proposal for a citizen parliament plus some sort of prediction-making ranking system to see who is providing accurate predictions of what's going on to sort information. This isn't being included due to the lack of familiarity with the system
* Groups or reforms that I essentially see as more incremental, such as reforms increasing transparency, openness in decision-making, or increasing access to legislators. These reforms are worthwhile, but could essentially be applies to whatever system is undertaken 

In principle, any intervention could be assessed using the following criteria. However, it is important to consider which criteria are appropriate and why; we should not necessarily aim for an intervention that does everything, but perhaps a series of interventions that can specialise in certain areas. The most important part of any system though is who gets decision-making power, and how does this manifest?

## Summary of Interventions Being Considered

#### [Mivote](https://www.mivote.org.au/what_is)

How does it work?
- Via app, person opts in/opts out of question being discussed
- Presents information on a topic, say, housing, along with different frameworks for understanding the topic
- After noting that the person has read some info on the topic (the 'information pack' provided), it gives at least 4 different 'policy approaches' to an issue that could plausibly be taken, person voting picks one
